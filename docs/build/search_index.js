Our model considers mechanical interactions between neighbouring cells and a secretion rate of new tissue material that is proportional to cell density. In this project we include cell proliferation, apoptosis (death) and embedment as stochastic processes. This model is solved using the DifferentialEquations.jl and ElasticArrays.jl packages. The solver uses RK4() or Euler() solving algorithms with a constant timestep Delta t. The stochastic cell behaviour is implemented using a PeriodicCallback and occurs every delta t_textevent period of time. This package offers 1D and 2D simulations. In our case 1D simulations imply the evolution of a line segment which has periodic boundaries and 2D is a closed domain. In the case of 2D simulations you can choose an inward or outward growth simulation by setting the appropriate parameters.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Model-Description","page":"Home","title":"Model Description","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This cell-based mathematical model ","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Calculates the mechanical relaxation and normal velocity in a system with periodic boundary conditions.
